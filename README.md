## Overview

The Simple Simulator and Assembler Project provides a set of tools to assemble and simulate simple assembly language programs. This project is designed to help understand the basics of how assemblers and simulators work by providing a hands-on toolkit for assembling and simulating instructions.

## Features

Assembler: Converts assembly language instructions into machine code.

Simulator: Executes the machine code instructions and provides an environment to test and debug assembly programs.

Automated Testing: Comprehensive testing suite to validate the correctness of the assembler and simulator.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.x**

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Simple_Simulator_Assembler_Project.git
cd Simple_Simulator_Assembler_Project
```

### Navigate to the assembler directory and run the assembler:
```
cd Simple_Simulator_Assembler/Simple-Assembler
python assembler.py
```

### Navigate to the simulator directory and run the simulator:
```
cd ../SimpleSimulator
python simulator.py
```

Run automated tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
```
cd ../automatedTesting
python run
```

## Usage

### Assembler

The assembler translates assembly code into machine code. To use the assembler, provide your assembly code in the appropriate format, and run the assembler.py script.

### Simulator

The simulator executes machine code generated by the assembler. Run the simulator.py script to start the simulation.

### Automated Testing

Automated tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the assembler and simulator. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to validate the functionality of the project.
